                    website for as many visitors as possible and to combat abuse and eliminate malfunctions.
                    For this purpose, it is necessary to log the technical data of the accessing computer in order to be
                    able to react as early as possible to display errors, attacks on our IT systems and/or errors in the
                    functionality of our website.

                    <p>We integrate and use cookies on various pages to enable certain functions of our website and to
                        integrate external web services.
                        The so-called "cookies" are small text files that your browser can store on your access device.
                        These text files contain a characteristic string that uniquely identifies the browser when you
                        return to our website.
                        The process of saving a cookie file is also referred to as "setting a cookie".
                        Cookies can be set both by the website itself and by external web services.</p>

                        In addition, it may be that the cookies increase their user-friendliness and enable a more
